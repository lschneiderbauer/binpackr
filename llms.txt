# binpackr

This package implements the First Fit Decreasing algorithm to achieve
one dimensional heuristic bin packing. Its run time is of order
$\mathcal{O}\left( n\, log(n) \right)$ where $n$ is the number of items
to pack.

## Installation

You can install the latest CRAN release of binpackr with:

``` r
install.packages("binpackr")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of binpackr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lschneiderbauer/binpackr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows to retrieve the solution for the bin
packing problem.

``` r
library(binpackr)

# Generate a vector of item sizes
set.seed(42)
x <- sample(100, 1000, replace = TRUE)

# Pack those items into bins of capacity 130
bins <- bin_pack_ffd(x, cap = 130)

# Number of bins needed to pack the items
print(length(unique(bins)))
#> [1] 389
```

## Benchmarks

The implementation in this package is compared to an implementation of
the same algorithm in the
[BBmisc](https://github.com/berndbischl/BBmisc) package. The authors
made it clear that speed was none of their concern. BBmisc’s
implementation is written in R while this package uses a C++
implementation.

### Run time
